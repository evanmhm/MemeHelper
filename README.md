# Meme Text Generator
This is just a little app I wrote for a friend to add 👏 inbetween every word or add extra spaces. Sort of a personal project to test my own web development/electron skills.
# Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/evanmhm/Meme-Text
cd Meme-Text
npm install
npm start
```
